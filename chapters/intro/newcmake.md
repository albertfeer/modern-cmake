## [CMake 3.30][]: C++26

This release adds C++26 support and a way to get the latest supported standard
for a compiler. This release makes a lot of small changes not listed below,
like better TLS support, some generator expression updates, and some schema
updates.

## [CMake 3.29][]: Build before testing

Finally you can make the `test` target depend on `ALL`, meaning `cmake --build
build -t test` will rebuild as needed! You have to opt-into this, though, by
setting `CMAKE_SKIP_TEST_ALL_DEPENDENCY` to false. Several improvements were
made for scripting, linker selection, and support was improved for various
compiler combinations on Windows.

- Initially released [March 21, 2024](https://www.kitware.com/cmake-3-29-0-available-for-download/)

- Select Intel OneAPI Fortran compiler with Visual Studio
- Compile CUDA on Windows with Clang

## [CMake 3.28][]: C++20 modules

This release adds [C++ module](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-cxxmodules.7.html)
support. This does not include C++23's `import std`, but is exciting step
forward for this landmark C++20 feature. These will be scanned by default if
using C++20+ and a new enough compiler and valid generator and if you have a
CMake minimum or maximum that includes CMake 3.28.

- Initially released [December 6, 2023](https://www.kitware.com/cmake-3-28-0-available-for-download/)

## [CMake 3.27][]: Debugger

This release adds the new CMake debugger! This should improve support for
debugging your CMake code in something like VSCode. This release also
"removes" FindPythonLibs/FindPythonInterp/FindCUDA; if the min or max version
is set to 3.27 or higher, the modules will be missing.

- Initially released [July 19, 2023](https://www.kitware.com/cmake-3-27-0-available-for-download/)
- C++ Modules extensions (`.ccm`, `.cxxm`, `.c++m`) are treated as C++
- `COMPILE_ONLY`, `LIST`, and `PATH` generator expressions added, along with a few more specific ones.

- FindCUDA simi-removed, use CUDA language and FindCUDAToolkit.
- FindPythonLibs & FindPythonInterp simi-removed, use FindPython.

## [CMake 3.26][]: Logging & Python

Two important additions for FindPython, PyPy SOABI support & LimitedAPI/StableABI support, really enhance FindPython's use. There are quite
a few nice fixes and new warnings, such as if you reverse the order of `project()` and `cmake_minimium_required()`. Logging has been moved
from `CMakeOutput.log` and `CMakeError.log` to a new `CMakeConfigureLog.yaml` log.

- Initially released [March 14, 2023](https://www.kitware.com/cmake-3-26-0-available-for-download/)
- FindPython generates the correct PyPy SOABI (finally!)

- `target_compile_options` now come after `target_compile_features` / `CMAKE_<LANG>_STANDARD`

## [CMake 3.25][]: Blocks and SYSTEM

CMake has new block scoping commands selectively controlling variables and
policies. It also has a lot more control over SYSTEM. The functional features
of CMake introduced a few releases ago are now usable in `find_` commands with
`VALIDATOR`. Workflows got an upgrade, too.

- Initially released [November 16, 2022](https://www.kitware.com/cmake-3-25-0-available-for-download/)

- Several improvements to `try_*` commands.
- `SYSTEM` target/directory property and `EXPORT_NO_SYSTEM` added, also for FetchContent.

## [CMake 3.24][]: Package Finder

This is a fantastic release. Package writers are getting integration between
`find_package` and `FetchContent` that will allow "download if missing"
workflows, and is configurable by packagers. Similarly, warnings as errors can
be set by a package and removed by packagers, as well (still make sure not to
do this unless you are being build as the main project!).

- Initially released [August 4, 2022](https://blog.kitware.com/cmake-3-24-0-is-available-for-download/)

- CUDA supports `native` to compile for the current GPUs detected.
- `SYSTEM` includes now are respected on MSVC generators.
- Better support for MSVC, XCode, and others.
- `LLVMFlang` compiler support.

## [CMake 3.23][]: Header only libraries

A solid release focused on header only libraries, more user control, CMake
presets, and better CUDA support. There are some powerful new features for
header only libraries, like the various `*_SETS` target properties. There are
new controls like the ability to restrict paths for `find_` commands and the
ability to remove `SYSTEM` from an existing target. You also get expanded
debugging features, and the ability to force all links to be to targets.
Presets can include other files. CUDA and C# received new updates, and a
couple of compilers were added.

- Initially released [March 29, 2022](https://blog.kitware.com/cmake-3-23-0-is-available-for-download/)

- `FindGTest` now adds a `GMock` target if found.

## [CMake 3.22][]: Handy env vars

A smaller release with some nice improvements all around focused on supporting
common build situations. You can finally set `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` in your
environment to set a default build type. There are several other new env vars
and variables too. Compiler flags related to standards have been improved.
`cmake_host_system_information` got improved further (from 3.10) with OS
information.

- Initially released [November 18, 2021](https://blog.kitware.com/cmake-3-22-0-available-for-download/)
- New environment variables for defaults, `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` and `CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES`

- `CMAKE_<LANG>_EXTENSIONS_DEFAULT` comes from the compiler
- `CMakeDependentOption` uses normal conditional syntax now
- CTest can now modify environment variables
- Some generators now use external (system) markers on includes for MSVC

## [CMake 3.21][] : Colors

Different message types now have different colors! There's now a nice variable
to see if you are in the top level project. Lots of continued cleanup and
specialized new features, such as adding the HIP language and C17 and C23
support. Presets continue to be improved.

- Initially released [July 14, 2021](https://blog.kitware.com/cmake-3-21-0-available-for-download/)

## [CMake 3.20][] : Docs

The CMake docs received a major boost in productivity by adding "new in" tags
to quickly see what was added without having to toggle documentation versions!
C++ 23 support added. Source files must have the extension listed now, and
LANGUAGE is always respected. Quite a bit of cleanup was done; make sure your
code is tested with `...3.20` before deploying that as your maximum. Presets
continue to be improved.

## [CMake 3.18][] : CUDA with Clang & CMake macro language

CUDA now supports Clang (without separable compilation). A new
`CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` property was implemented to better support targeting CUDA
hardware. A new `cmake_language` command supports calling cmake commands and
expressions from strings. Lots of other meta changes that could make new
designs available; calling functions by variable, evaluating arbitrary CMake by
string, and configure files directly from strings. Many other nice tiny
features and papercut fixes are sprinkled throughout, a small selection is below.

- Initially released [July 15, 2020](https://blog.kitware.com/cmake-3-18-0-available-for-download/)
- `cmake` can `cat` files together now

## [CMake 3.17][] : More CUDA

A FindCUDAToolkit was finally added, which allows finding and using the CUDA
toolkit without enabling the CUDA language! CUDA now is a bit more configurable,
such as linking to shared libraries. Quite a bit more polish in the expected areas,
as well, like FindPython. Finally, you can now iterate over multiple lists at a time.

## [CMake 3.16][] : Unity builds

A new unity build mode was added, allowing source files to be merged into a single build file. Support for
precompiled headers (possibly preparing for C++20 modules, perhaps?) was added. Lots of other smaller
fixes were implemented, especially to newer features, such as to FindPython, FindDoxygen, and others.

## [CMake 3.15][] : CLI upgrade

This release has many smaller polishing changes, include several of improvements to the CMake command line, such as control over the default generator through environment variables (so now it's easy to change the default generator to Ninja). Multiple targets are supported in `--build` mode, and `--install` mode added. CMake finally supports multiple levels of logging. Generator expressions gained a few handy tools. The still very new FindPython module continues to improve, and FindBoost is now more inline with Boost 1.70's new CONFIG
module. `export(PACKAGE)` has drastically changed; it now no longer touches `$HOME/.cmake` by default (if CMake Minimum version is 3.15 or higher), and requires an extra step if a user wants to use it. This is generally less surprising.

- Compiler and list improvements to generator expressions

## [CMake 3.14][] : File utilities (AKA [CMake π](https://blog.kitware.com/kitware-gets-mathematical-with-cmake-π-on-pi-day/))

This release has lots of small cleanups, including several utilities for files. Generator expressions work in a few more places, and list handling is better with empty variables.
Quite a few more find packages produce targets. The new Visual Studio 16 2019 generator is a bit different than older versions. Windows XP and Vista support has been dropped.

- Initially released [March 14, 2019](https://blog.kitware.com/cmake-3-14-0-available-for-download/)
- The cmake `--build` command gained `-v/--verbose`, to use verbose builds if your build tool supports it
- The FILE command gained `CREATE_LINK`, `READ_SYMLINK`, and `SIZE`
- {{ command.format('get_filename_component') }} gained `LAST_EXT` and `NAME_WLE` to access just the _last_ extension on a file, which would get `.zip` on a file such as `version.1.2.zip` (very handy!)
- You can see if a variable is defined in the CACHE with `DEFINED CACHE{VAR}` in an {{ command.format('if') }} statement.
- `BUILD_RPATH_USE_ORIGIN` and CMake version were added to improve handling of RPath in the build directory.
- The CMake server mode is now being replaced with a file API, starting in this release. Will affect IDEs in the long run.

## [CMake 3.13][] : Linking control

You can now make symbolic links on Windows! Lots of new functions that fill out the
popular requests for CMake, such as `add_link_options`, `target_link_directories`, and
`target_link_options`. You can now do quite a bit more modification to targets outside
of the source directory, for better file separation. And, `target_sources` _finally_ handles relative paths properly (policy 76).

- Initially released [November 20, 2018](https://blog.kitware.com/cmake-3-13-0-available-for-download/)

## [CMake 3.12][] : Version ranges and CONFIGURE_DEPENDS

Very powerful release, containing lots of smaller long-requested features. One of the smaller
but immediately noticeable changes is the addition of version ranges;
you can now set both the minimum and maximum known CMake version easily. You can also set
`CONFIGURE_DEPENDS` on a `GLOB`ed set of files, and the build system will check those files and
rerun if needed! You can use the general `PackageName_ROOT`
for all `find_package` searches. Lots of additions to strings and lists, module updates,
shiny new Python find module (2 and 3 versions too), and many more.

## [CMake 3.3][] : if IN_LIST

This is notable for the useful `IN_LIST` option for if, but it also added better library search using `$PATH` (See CMake 3.6), dependencies for INTERFACE libraries, and several other useful improvements. The addition of a `COMPILE_LANGUAGE` generator expression would prove very useful in the future as more languages are added. Makefiles now produce better output in parallel.

- Initially released [July 23, 2015](https://blog.kitware.com/cmake-3-3-0-released/)
- `IN_LIST` added to `if`
- `*_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE` property added
- `COMPILE_LANGUAGE` generator expression (limited support in some generators)

## [CMake 3.2][] : UTF8

This is a smaller release, with mostly small features and fixes. Internal changes, like better Windows and UTF8 support, were the focus.

- Initially released [March 11, 2015](https://blog.kitware.com/cmake-3-2-1-released/)
- `continue()` inside loops
- File and directory locks added

## [CMake 3.1][] : C++11 and compile features

This is the first release of CMake to support C++11. Combined with fixes to the new features of CMake 3.0, this is currently a common minimum version of CMake for libraries that want to support old CMake builds.

- Initially released [December 17, 2014](https://blog.kitware.com/cmake-3-1-0-released/)
- C++11 Support
- Compile features support
- Sources can be added later with `target_sources`
- Better support for generator expressions and INTERFACE targets

## [CMake 3.0][] : Interface libraries

There were a ton of additions to this version of CMake, primarily to fill out the target interface. Some bits of needed functionality were missed and implemented in CMake 3.1 instead.

- Initially released [June 10, 2014](https://blog.kitware.com/cmake-3-0-0-available-for-download/)
- New documentation
- INTERFACE libraries
- Project VERSION support
- Exporting build trees easily
- Bracket arguments and comments available (not widely used)
- Lots of improvements
